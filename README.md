# Deep orientation-aware functional maps: Tackling symmetry issues in Shape Matching
<!-- # DUO-FM: Unsupervised Orientation-Aware Learning for Non-rigid Shape Matching -->

This is our implementation of Deep orientation-aware functional maps, 
a Shape Matching Network that builds comprehensive orientation-aware features from surfaces
to compute accurate correspondence between pairs of shapes.
